We are designing a neural network to classify images of clothes to assist in the return process at a shipping facility. People will load clothing items onto a conveyer belt which will bring them to a camera. The camera will capture the image as a 28x28 grayscale picture, and our neural network should give return one of the 10 different classes as a result. Afterward, the item will be shipped to its corresponding department. 

Any mistakes will take time as the items will need to be walked back to the correct section of the warehouse. We have calculated that the network should be at least 91% accurate to ensure this sorting process is beneficial. We have prepared a training set of 60,000 pictures of clothes to train our network and 10,000 pictures to test against. Our goal is to make a network that can classify images of clothes with at least 91% accuracy.
